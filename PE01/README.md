# PE01 - MyResume

# Input
The required tools for this project are React and VS Code. Knowledge of JavaScript, html and CSS would be beneficial. GitHub Codespaces can be utilized as well to enable remote access.

The input for this project comes from the Resume.js component. Resume.js contains the body of the resume which includes personal information, such as name, address, education, skills, and projects.


# Process
The data in Resume.js is processed within React component and is structured to display the body of the resume. The appearance of the resume will be dictated by the Resume.css file. Resume.css file is used to style the layout by applying rules that are set within the file, e.g., the background color, text color, margins, and fonts, etc. React renders the component based on these set of rules and dynamically re-renders the component as changes are made on Resume.css file.

# Output
The output of this program is a styled resume web page that displays the user's information in an organized manner. The resume will be displayed with a specific background color as specified in the requirement.
