# PE05 - Recipes

# Input
The input for this project comes from user input on a form where they can enter the name, ingredients, time, and steps for a recipe. The recipes will be saved in MongoDB.

# Process
The homepage will show a list of recipes that are available in the database. The user can add a new recipe using the Add Recipe button, which will open a new component to enter the name, ingredients, time, and steps. The user can edit and delete each recipe using the Edit and Delete button that are placed next to the recipe's name. Clicking the Edit button will open another page where the user can edit the name, ingredients, time, and steps for this recipe. Clicking the Delete button will open a pop up window to confirm the deletion.

# Output
The output is a simple list of recipes that are saved in the database. The names of the recipes are visible along with Edit and Delete buttons. The user can click on the recipe's name to show the detail of the recipes.
